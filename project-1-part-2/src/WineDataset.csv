"Silver Ghost Sauvignon Blanc 2022/23, Central Valley","Just because it’s inexpensive, doesn’t mean it’s not great quality. This wine is actually made for us by one of the most prestigious winemaking families in Chile, the Arestis. They know how to get the very best peachy, citrussy flavours out of their grapes, while still keeping prices wallet-friendly. The Central Valley, where this wine is from, is cool but has loads of sunshine – so this is more like a ripe white Bordeaux than a full, tropically fruity Kiwi Sauvignon. The fact is, Chilean wines are just incredible value – a wine of this quality from another country could cost far more. In our book, that makes it the ideal party wine. It’s got a real citrussy zing and great tropical flavours. It’s incredibly refreshing, so your guests will be happy to drink it alone, or with finger foods. It’s hard working bottle which won’t disappoint.",£6.99 per bottle,75CL,,Screwcap,9,per bottle,White,ABV 12.00%,Central Valley,Crisp & Zesty
"Russian Jack Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","European settlers arrived in New Zealand in 1840, and set about clearing scrub from what are now top winemaking regions. Originally from Latvia, Russian Jack was one of these gentlemen of the road.  He'd appear on farms at harvest time to pick fruit, well into his old age. As a result, he became a bit of a legend. There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and there’s no compromise on quality. Every vintage has only one bottling, with the wine left on its spent yeast cells (or ‘lees’) to concentrate the flavours and add texture. This is a seriously aromatic Sauvignon, with notes of passionfruit, elderflower and gooseberry. Try it with spicy grilled fish.",£12.99 per bottle,75CL,,Screwcap,9.8,per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty
The Guv'nor VIP 6 Bottle Wine Case,"Just when you thought all the rules were broken…The Guv’nor VIP is not the best of two worlds, but three. Robbing grapes from some of the biggest names in Spain –Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Toro - this pioneering bandit doesn’t care about tradition. Only great taste. The Guv’nor VIP is an upgrade on everything the Guv'nor stands for: better grapes, meticulously applied oak, and an even smoother, fruitier taste. He’s taken Majestic’s number one best-selling wine, and made it even better. The Guv’nor rewrote the rule book on wine, taking away vintages, classifications and restrictions. The VIP just wrote a new chapter. The Guv’nor VIP launches exclusively in time for Summer 2023. Drink on warm summer evenings, paired with barbecues or around campfires. This wine packs a punch with bold flavours of black cherry, red plum, and blackberry fruits, balanced with a touch of savoury oak and mellow spice. It's like a black forest gateau with a kick.",£59.94 per case,Our,,,,per case,Red,,,
Caves des Vignerons de Buxy 'Vieilles Vignes' Montagny 2021/22,"Montagny is an appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise. It’s a real enclave of quality, specialising in Chardonnay. In fact, it’s the only grape that’s grown in the whole region – so Montagny-based Cave de Buxy really know their Chardonnay inside-out. Montagny’s limestone soils mean the wines are fresh, with a fuller body than other Chalonnaise wines. The fruit flavours are really pronounced – a factor amped up by the fact that it’s ‘Vielles Vignes’. It’s made using grapes from thirty-year-old vines. Because they’re old, they only yield small amounts of grapes – so all the flavour is exceptionally concentrated. Think ripe apple, citrus and white blossom. The ripeness is balanced by serious crispness, and it’s left unoaked so the fruit flavours can really shine through. Perfect with chicken.",£16.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,10.5,per bottle,White,ABV 14.00%,Burgundy,Ripe & Rounded
"Thymiopoulos Xinomavro 2019/20, Greece","If you're looking to get into Greek wine, Xinomavro is a great place to start. It's one of Greece's star grapes. Think of it as a delicious cross between Barbaresco and Pinot Noir. This example is made by a man who’s widely recognised as an expert in the art of crafting great Xinomavro. It’s medium-bodied and complex, with notes of red and black fruit, a vibrant acidity and a long finish. Serve with lamb shank.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,9.8,per bottle,Red,ABV 13.00%,Greece,Savoury & Full Bodied
Bodegas Bardos Ribera del Duero Reserva 2016/18,"Bodegas Bardos sits in the toughest and coldest area of Ribera del Duero, at almost 1,000 metres above sea level. The high-altitude brings elegance and freshness to their bold and powerful wines. This Reserva is made from low-yielding Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Tim Atkin awarded the 2016 vintage with an impressive 96 points. Aged for 16 months in French oak, it has excellent structure, with balanced tannins and refreshing acidity. Discover rich notes of dark fruit, chocolate, vanilla and smoky-wood spice. Try it with a lamb casserole.",£17.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,10.9,per bottle,Red,ABV 14.50%,Castilla Y León,Savoury & Full Bodied
"Pelleriti 'Signature' Malbec 2019/20, Mendoza","Marcelo Pelleriti is the first Latin American winemaker to ever score a perfect 100 Parker Points. He has more than 30 years of winemaking experience between Bordeaux and Argentina. And he certainly knows a thing or two about creating first-class wine in the Malbec capital of the world, Mendoza. This is a ripe and fruity wine, with notes of black fruit, red berries and jam. Try it with sirloin steak.",£17.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,10.9,per bottle,Red,ABV 14.50%,Mendoza,Rich & Juicy
"Definition Malbec 2021/22, Mendoza","Argentine Malbec is so popular, few people realise the grape is actually native to France. Mendoza, Argentina’s Malbec-heartland, is the place to look for the style of lush, fruity Malbec which put Argentina on the map. So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to our Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley – a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we sourced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flavours. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness. It’s a really classic style – so it’s perfect with a good steak or other barbecued meats.

In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2020 vintage.",£11.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,10.9,per bottle,Red,ABV 14.50%,Mendoza,Soft & Fruity
"Jackson Estate 'Stich' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","This is named after Jackson Estate’s founder, John ‘Stich’ Stichbury, whose family have deep roots in Marlborough. But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. They’re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. That’s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees – giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flavours, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb. Think gooseberry and zingy rhubarb flavours that are perfect with goat's cheese.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,,Screwcap,9.8,per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty
Bodegas Bardos Ribera del Duero Crianza 2019/20,"The high-altitude region of Ribera del Duero is known for its robust and deeply fruity red wines. A short and hot growing season helps produce Tempranillo grapes with intense and complex flavours. Bodegas Bardos works in one of the region's most challenging areas to capture the signature style at its very best. After 14 months in oak, it’s beautifully aromatic and has notes of ripe cherry and blackberry, velvety tannins and a complex, spicy finish. The intensity of fruit and fresh acidity make it an excellent pairing for grilled lamb chops.",£14.99 per bottle,75CL,Cabernet Sauvignon,Natural Cork,10.9,per bottle,Red,ABV 14.50%,Castilla Y León,Savoury & Full Bodied
"LB7 Red Reserva 2018, Lisbon","The delicious LB7 Red is one of our bestselling wines. So what does the Reserva bring to the table? We dial up the flavour and complexity by maturing it in American and French oak. This attention to detail results in a rich and elegant wine that's incredibly food-friendly. Full. Smooth. Moreish. Expect lots of jammy red- and black-fruit flavour with fine tannins. Perfect for roast lamb.

"Carpe Diem Feteasca Alba 2021/22, Moldova","No country better demonstrates the hidden treasures of Eastern Europe than Moldova. Many drinkers might regard it as a relatively new winemaking country; however, wines have been produced here for over five thousand years. Soviet times saw a drop off in quality and reputation, but producers such as Carpe Diem continue to set new trends for the industry. For four generations, the Lucas family have dedicated their lives to crafting expressive wines that reflect their unique terroir and local wine making traditions. However, the last century presented significant obstacles. In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas’ vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving. While the Soviet threat has returned – with the winery pausing operations to aid their Ukrainian neighbours – their wines continue to go from strength to strength.

"Cape Mentelle Shiraz 2018, Margaret River","Cape Mentelle is one of Margaret River’s 'founding five' wineries. A benchmark for quality, they're celebrated for having pioneered many of this Western Australian wine region's renowned styles. Despite other grape varieties often taking the limelight, Shiraz really flourishes here. A cooler coastal influence results in a more restrained style than the bold-and-jammy Shiraz of Barossa and Mclaren Vale. In a nod towards the traditional Syrah blends of the Rhône Valley's Côte-Rôtie, winemaker Eloise Jarvis blends her red Shiraz grapes with white Viognier to dial up the complexity. Viognier is rich and aromatic, so adding it to a blend brings freshness, softens tannins, and enhances any fruity and floral notes. Côte-Rôtie wines usually come with lofty prices, but this Cape Mentelle favourite means you can enjoy the style at a fraction of the cost. Expect a complex and structured wine with layers of violets, dark forest fruits and wild cherries. Intense savoury notes of tobacco, leather and spice mean this wine matches well with simple grilled meats or rich vegetable-laden stews.",£32.99 per bottle,75CL,,Screwcap,11.3,per bottle,Red,ABV 15.00%,,Bold & Spicy

With an aim to create the purest expression of Saint-Émilion, Château Fonplégade recruited one of the world's most sought-after winemaking consultants and made the change to entirely organic farming. Predominantly Merlot with just enough Cabernet Franc to add structure, this blend is made from hand-picked grapes from their oldest vines.

Grato Grati ‘Vecchia Annata’ Rosso Toscana 1999,"Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG – Chianti’s most northerly subzone – and the area renowned for making the region’s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity – and it’s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential.
